Enhancing the Project for Your CV
To stand out, consider including the following components in your project:

Framework and Structure:

Build a modular framework where new strategies can be added easily.
Example: A function for each strategy and a unified backtesting pipeline.
Comparison of Strategies:

Compare all implemented strategies using consistent metrics (e.g., CAGR, volatility, Sharpe ratio, Max Drawdown, VaR).
Present the results in a clean table or visualization.
Dynamic Visualization:

Plot portfolio values for all strategies on the same graph.
Use interactive tools like Plotly to allow users to explore different strategies.
Transaction Costs:

Incorporate transaction costs (e.g., 0.1% of trade value) to make the backtest realistic.
Documentation and ReadMe:

Write clear documentation explaining each strategy, the metrics calculated, and how to use the code.
Deployment:

Consider deploying your project on a platform like Streamlit or Flask to make it interactive.
Example: Allow users to upload their own data and test strategies in a web app.
How to Pitch It on Your CV
Hereâ€™s how you can describe this project on your resume or LinkedIn:

Example 1 (Resume):

Quantitative Portfolio Optimization Framework

Designed and implemented a Python-based backtesting framework to evaluate multiple portfolio strategies, including 1/N, Risk Parity, Mean-Variance Optimization, and Momentum.
Backtested strategies on historical data for equities, bonds, and commodities, analyzing performance using CAGR, Sharpe ratio, volatility, VaR, and max drawdown.
Visualized portfolio performance and risk metrics using Matplotlib and Plotly, highlighting insights for portfolio allocation.
Gained hands-on experience with asset pricing, data preprocessing, and investment risk management.
Example 2 (LinkedIn):

Backtesting and Portfolio Optimization Framework
Developed a Python-based framework for systematic portfolio construction and backtesting using historical data. Implemented and analyzed multiple allocation strategies, including 1/N, Risk Parity, and Mean-Variance Optimization.

Conducted quantitative analysis of performance metrics (CAGR, volatility, Sharpe ratio, VaR).
Integrated data visualization tools to create dynamic performance graphs for portfolios.
Demonstrated a passion for quantitative trading and portfolio research through innovative and data-driven insights.
